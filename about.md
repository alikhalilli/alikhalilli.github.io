I am a graduate of B.Eng in Computer Science _(2011-2015)_. At university I was focused on artificial intelligence, decision making systems, controlling systems, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms. My thesis was about "Type-2 Fuzzy Logic based Decision Making System".
I'm passionate about applying my knowledge of computer science and machine learning in genetics and genomics.
In my opinion, computer science will help faster improvement of human race.
